        After Earth’s famous satellite visualization “The Blue Marble” of 1972, we have engaged in a view of the planet, where Earth, as WTJ Mitchell explained, has been treated as an image. This has been so much so that entering any physical space is like entering a virtual picture where the subject is only a character in a preconceived stage. Sociologist Rolando Vázquez also spoke to the impact that Blue Marble has had in our experience of the planet when he wrote that:

        <blockquote>
            <i>
                On December 7, 1972, the Apollo 17 crew took the first photograph of Earth: ‘Blue Marble.’ This photograph accomplishes the renaissance geographers’ dream of reducing planet Earth to an object of representation; it is a moment in which the anthropocentric gaze achieves, as it were, its historical completion, the absurdity of its totality. The conception of the Earth as a prison, the will to emancipate the ‘‘Human’’ from Earth, and the reduction of Earth to representation are all expressions of modernity’s world as artifice, its anthropocentrism, and its loss of earth as relation. ‘‘Blue Marble’’ comes to signify the transmogrification of Earth into an object of appropriation, representation, consumption, and waste. It signifies the forgetfulness of earth as grounding precedence.
            </i>
        </blockquote>

        Following Vázquez’s assertion about the loss of land rootedness and situatedness, our summer program titled <a href='/'><i>The Rise of the Coyote</i></a> invites participating artists, curators, and thinkers to take a trip back to Earth. Alluding not only to a renewed perspective on the planet but a larger planetary consciousness, our return back to Earth will entail entering into entangled relationalities of mutuality and co-adaption both with the multiplicities of the soil as interdependent organism, as well as with the communities, grassroots organization, and bodies that carry out these vital relationships through quotidian acts of care.
        <br>
        <br>
        This return to earth-based thinking/being entails, moreover, reimagining the technological devices and ideologies that have separated us from nature in the first place. Taking as a point of departure a critique of the self-proclaimed universality of western technology, this program seeks to understand other paradigms of technological knowing and doing. Contesting western technology’s technoscientific approach, our tutors and collaborators will guide us into exploring local definitions of indigenous technologies and their socio-technical approach, which bear forms of relationality, mutuality, and reciprocity that can enable our capacity to “cultivate life.” Through other definitions of technology, a planetary consciousness delineates narratives of hope that refuse extractivism and extinction proposing instead renewed or repaired relations to earth, to communities, and to our bodies. It enables, in short, the end of the one-world narrative encapsulated by the image of the Blue Marble, while simultaneously reorienting us towards frameworks for worlding the world.

        The Rise of the Coyote, in that regard, employs Nuahua artist <a href='https://www.houseofgaga.com/59_Fernando_Palma_Rodriguez.php'>Fernando Palma Rodriguez</a>’s celestial figure and cyborg, the Aztec deity Huehuecoyotl; also known as the old man coyote. This deity, central to the Aztec cosmogony known as one between human and animal.  Huehuecoyotl has the capacity to navigate a multiplicity of worlds, many of which constitute variegated and contradictory ecosystems. As a trickster of infinite interchangeability, the Huehuecoyotl stands in as a form of becoming our animal, plant, and sentient other; allowing us to access inter-subjective relations within the multiple worlds that we already inhabit. This inter-species engagement will be established in collaboration with grassroots organizations in the outskirts of Mexico City.
        <br>
        <br>
        As a collaborative practice rooted in place, the program will depart from the slopes of the Teuhtli volcano, which is the geographical  border between the municipalities of Milpa Alta, Tláhuac, and Xochimilco. The program will thus depart from a commitment to listening and learning from local community members and social organizations that fight on a day-to-day towards social justice, environmental equity, land sovereignty, and emancipation. Assuming ourselves as cyborg coyotes, we will enter into entangled relationalities with the territory, its soil, and its community to listen and learn from otherworldly visualities and sensibilities. Imagining new possibilities for being and existing on the Earth, our engagement with indigenous technologies will prompt us into a web of mutually supported agents alongside ancestral, natural, and other-than-human actants.
