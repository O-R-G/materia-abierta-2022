Activities will include reading seminars, public lectures, and group discussions as well as fieldwork in the Milpa Alta and Xochimilco territories, and hands-on workshops â€” for example, a community mechatronics workshop and another on food sovereignty based on the cultivation of the milpa. Curricular activities will take place on Monday and Wednesday mornings and Thursday afternoons; Tuesdays and Saturdays will be dedicated to field visits, and Fridays and Sundays will be days off. These times are subject to change based on logistical rearrangements.
