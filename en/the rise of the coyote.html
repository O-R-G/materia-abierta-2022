This year’s program is an invitation to take a trip back to Earth. Through the invocation of Huehuecóyotl, the Aztec deity known as the old coyote, we will search for forms of relationality, reciprocity, and mutuality within the natural, ancestral, and human worlds we inhabit. In order to get closer to these pluriversal paradigms, the program will question the historic tendency of Western technologies to exploit the earth and will explore diverse local practices and sociotechnic conditions where technology reveals itself as the capacity to “cultivate life.”
