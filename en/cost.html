Through institutional support, Materia Abierta will offer a limited number of full and partial scholarships for candidates from the Global South and for people who cannot cover the full cost. Those who wish to be considered for any of these supports must indicate that in the application form, where relevant financial information will be requested. Likewise, we have an additional support fund that allows members of our community to provide resources and support the scholarship program directly. Materia Abierta can issue letters of support to people selected for the program who wish to request external financing to cover the costs of their participation.
