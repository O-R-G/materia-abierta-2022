		The program will research the relationships among several thematic axes: Indigenous robotics, plant intelligence, and notions of futurity endemic to the native peoples of the south of what is now the Valley of Mexico. Unlike Western technology, based on the principles of exploitation and domination, the approaches to technology that we will seek to understand are oriented toward frameworks of reciprocity and re-existence. Thought of as a total social fact, these technologies are not based on identity concepts, but on local knowledge systems. Through the figure of the robot, and following artist Paula Gaetano Adiâ€™s provocation, we will seek an alliance with rebellious machines that allow us to embody life forms that blur categorical boundaries between temporalities and species.
