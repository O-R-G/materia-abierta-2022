		<b>Curator</b>
		<br><br>
		<b>Sara Garzón</b> is a researcher and curator. Specializing in contemporary Latin American art, Sara’s research focuses on issues related to decoloniality, temporality, and Indigenous eco-criticism.

Her texts have been published in Hemisphere: Visual Cultures of the <i>Americas, Anamesa: An Interdisciplinary Journal, DASartes Magazine, Ocula Magazine, and Hyperallergic</i>.

		<b>Paula Gaetano Adi</b> is an Argentinian-born artist whose robotic projects and scholarly practice draw from studies of technoscience, decoloniality, and artificial life and enact speculative scenarios that stress the power of technological speculation in illuminating new social narratives and new images of the possible. She has exhibited work in both solo and group shows in museums and media art festivals throughout Europe, Asia, and the Americas in locales such as the National Art Museum of China, MejanLabs Gallery Stockholm, SECS São Paulo, Vancouver National Art Gallery, Pera Museum Istanbul, Festival Transitio Mexico, and National Museum of Poznan. Among other distinctions, she is the recipient of the First Prize VIDA 9.0, the First Prize ‘LIMBØ’ Museum of Modern Art of Buenos Aires; and Fundación Telefónica’s Art & Artificial Life Award for Ibero-American artists. Gaetano Adi is currently Associate Professor of Experimental & Foundation Studies at the Rhode Island School of Design and a PhD candidate at the European Graduate School in Switzerland. Prior to her appointment at RISD, she served on the faculty of the Electronics Arts program at the Universidad Nacional de Tres de Febrero and directed the New Media Arts program at the University of North Texas. She was visiting scholar at the Center for Research in Engineering, Media and Performance at UCLA and artist-in-residence at EMPAC, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute.

		<b>Laboratorio Lacustre</b> is a collective and multidisciplinary space for creative experimentation, founded in 2017 for the knowledge and reflection on the geographical, environmental, and symbolic territory of the perilacustrine neighborhoods of Xochimilco. Its objective is to create  proposals for the reterritorialization of neighborhoods through art, design, and research and the generation of various practices and collaborations with the original or neighboring communities for the sustainable use of their territory. Laboratorio Lacustre's theoretical support is the study of urban and rural territories, starting from the so-called Theory of Multiplicities' from the work of Felix Guatiari and Gilles Deleuze, as well as Rogerio Haesbaert’s work on deterritoriality and multiterritoriality. In 2021 they published <i>Manual para el conocimiento, uso y aprovechamiento de plantas lacustres y su contextualización territorial en los barrios de Xochimilco</i>, the first of three projected volumes. Processes, techniques, and a toolkit were developed in these manuals for the sustainable use of three plants: water lily , duckweed and tule . For the implementation phase of the strategy, a multidisciplinary collective of four members was formed, and a space for collective, participatory, and co-design experimentation was designed and built.

		<b>Calpulli Tecalco</b> is an NGO created for the revitalization and preservation of Indigenous cultures. It gathers and combines knowledge of oral, scientific, social, technological, and artistic tradition through alliances with people, communities, and institutions interested in community work, ancestral cultures, and the environment. In particular, it focuses on the ancestral knowledge that Indigenous peoples of the southern Basin of Mexico have made in their interaction with the environment, creating nature reserves and highly sustainable agricultural systems that today are in danger of being lost. In its 23-year history, Calpulli Tecalco has carried out community actions, projects, and programs in different languages, as well as around 1,500 workshops on agriculture, science outreach, the Nahuatl language, local history, art, robotics, and archaeology, among others. Some current projects are <i>Adopta una Milpa</i>, a transdisciplinary laboratory on the restoration of the terraced agricultural system in Malacachtepec Momoxco, Milpa Alta, and <i>Sobre los pies del Teuhtli Tizalcalco: Archaeological Heritage of Milpa Alta</i>, a project that integrates archaeology, architecture, and earth sciences around the investigation of the Mesoamerican town of Tizacalco, located on the slopes of the Teuhtli volcano in Milpa Alta.

		<b>Mujeres de la tierra, mujeres de la periferia</b> is a collective of women who live in Santa Ana Tlacotenco, Milpa Alta. They work and resist against domestic and labor violence against women, and defend the territory they inhabit with the practices of sowing and the care and protection of seeds. They embrace cultivation and the place of the stove as symbols of their resistance and struggle to achieve financial autonomy based on the traditional kitchen and the promotion of food made from blue corn, beans, and nopal; the practice of planting and caring for the land; and working through their experiences with violence through support networks. They embrace communitary feminism as a point of departure to change the realities around their work, history, memory, and voice, achieving it via the sharing of knowledge with other women, men, and dissident movements and the sale of the food that they harvest.
