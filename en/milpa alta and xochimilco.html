Specifically, work will be carried out in the vicinity of Teuhtli, a volcano that serves as an identity reference and geographical limit between both municipalities. The activities will take place in venues associated with collectives and community centers such as the civil association Calpulli Tecalco and the collective Mujeres de la Tierra from Milpa Alta, and the Laboratorio Lacustre in Xochimilco.</span>

The activities will take place in venues associated with collectives and community centers such as the civil association Calpulli Tecalco and the collective Mujeres de la Tierra from Milpa Alta, and the Laboratorio Lacustre in Xochimilco. Likewise, over four weeks, activities will be carried out at MUAC as well as in places such as Casa del Lago, located within the Chapultepec Forest, bringing into focus the political tension between the geographical center of Mexico City and its peripheral south.

Historically, these territories have been a refuge for Indigenous knowledge and shelter an enormous biocultural diversity. The people who live in Milpa Alta and Xochimilco, prominently of Nahua descent, are incomparable examples of self-organization and struggle against the precariousness derived from phenomena such as industrial gentrification, contamination of the subsoil, the eradication of native languages, forced displacement, and the extraction of natural resources. The program is designed to provoke forms of collective work and intimate complicity with local groups and collectives that inhabit, build, and defend these places through ancestral knowledge and the care for the web of life.
