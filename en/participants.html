        A group of 25 people will be selected to participate through the open call. Likewise, a limited number of spaces will be awarded directly through institutional invitations. The intention is to form a diverse, critical, and politically active group of participants who seek to interrogate the hegemonic systems through which dominant culture and knowledge are produced.
        <br><br>
        Activities are conducted in Spanish and English, with simultaneous translation only on some occasions. Knowledge of both languages is highly recommended for participation, although the act of collective translation and its challenges are favored as a natural part of the group's social dynamics.
